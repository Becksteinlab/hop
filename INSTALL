This document gives an overview over additional requirements that
should be installed before Hop and Hop's installation process. The
latter should be painless because it only consists of pure python
scripts at the moment.

Please do not hesitate to contact Oliver Beckstein
<orbeckst@gmail.com> if problems occur or if you have suggestions how
to improve the package or these instructions.


Quick instructions
==================

If you are familiar with ``easy_install`` from ``setuptools`` then try

  easy_install Hop-0.1rc1.tar,gz

or 

  cd Hop-0.1rc1
  python setup.py install

Otherwise read the Requirements and Installation instructions below.


Requirements
============

The future the Hop installer should handle some of these dependencies
automatically; if not you will have to install packages manually. This
is true in particular for MDAnalysis at the moment. matplotlib is also
desirable but failed to install cleanly automatically.


* Tested with python 2.4, 2.5 (2.3 might still work, too) on Linux and
  Mac OS X.

* Required python modules:

MDAnalysis*   >= 0.6 or UNSTABLE    http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com
numpy         >=1.0.3               http://numpy.scipy.org/
NetworkX**    <0.99                 https://networkx.lanl.gov/
pygraphviz    0.36                  https://networkx.lanl.gov/pygraphviz/

*)  MDAnalysis requires additional modules; see the instructions at
    its home page. Get the latest snapshot
       http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com/files/MDAnalysis-0.6.0-rc1.tar.gz
    or get the development version via subversion:
       svn checkout http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com/svn/branches/development-UNSTABLE-orbeckst MDAnalysis_UNSTABLE 

**) Hop has not been updated yet to use the new NetworkX 1.0 API
    hence only earlier versions (e.g. 0.36) are going to work reliably.



Optional modules (reduced functionality if not present):

matplotlib       >=0.91.3           http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ 
rpy (and R)                         http://rpy.sourceforge.net/

When these modules are missing the code will raise an ImportError when
attempting to use them; their absence is not handled gracefuly and it
is suggested to install at least matplotlib/pylab. R and rpy are only
used for an experimental heatmap analysis and can be safely ignored.


Many packages can be found through the local package manager (eg apt,
fink, yum, rpm). networkx is available at the above URL or with the
`easy_install' command from python setuptools.

In Debian/Ubuntu/fink:

   apt-get install python-setuptools pkg-config

   apt-get install graphviz graphviz-dev
   easy_install networkx
   easy_install pygraphviz


Interactive use and ipython
---------------------------

When Hop was developed, interactive use from a python command shell
turned out to be a very convenient application paradigm. 'ipython' is
very much recommended because of its ease to obtain interactive help
via '?' and '??' and to inspect objects via TAB-completion. This is
especially helpful because most of the documentation is provided as
python doc strings, both at the module and at the class level.

For instance, to get an overview over interactive usage, load the
hop.interactive module and query the top level doc string:

 import hop.interactive
 hop.interactive ?



Installation
============

Standard EasyInstall installation
---------------------------------

The Hop package can be installed with 'EasyInstall' which is part of
'setuptools' (http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools).

If you have setuptools already installed you should be able to simply
install with

   easy_install Hop-0.1-rc1.tar.gz

You can install 'setuptools' by following the instructions at
http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installation-instructions
or on Linux distributions such as Debian or Ubuntu by a
commandline similar to

   apt-get install python-setuptools

Note that easy_install tries to download additional packages via the
internet if it cannot find them installed already.


Installation in a custom location
---------------------------------

If you want to install Hop somewhere else but the system default
please have a look at
http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#custom-installation-locations
which describes custom installations.
