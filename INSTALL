This document gives an overview over additional requirements that
should be installed before Hop and Hop's installation process. The
latter should be painless because it only consists of pure python
scripts at the moment.



Requirements
============

Tested with python 2.3, 2.4, 2.5

Required python modules:

numpy         >=1.0.3               http://numpy.scipy.org/
MDAnalysis*   >= 0.6 or UNSTABLE    http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com
NetworkX**    <0.99                 https://networkx.lanl.gov/
pygraphviz    0.36                  https://networkx.lanl.gov/pygraphviz/

*)  MDAnalysis requires additional modules; see the instructions at
    its home page
**) Hop has not been updated yet to use the new NetworkX 1.0 API
    hence only earlier versions (e.g. 0.36) are going to work reliably.


Optional modules (reduced functionality if not present):

pylab            >=0.91.3           http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ 
rpy (and R)                         http://rpy.sourceforge.net/

(When these are missing the code will raise an ImportError when
attempting to use these modules; their absence is not handled
gracefuly and it is very much suggested to install them.)


Many packages are found through the local package manager (eg apt,
fink, yum, rpm). networkx is available at the above URL or with the
`easy_install' command from python setuptools.

In Debian/Ubuntu/fink:

   apt-get install python-setuptools pkg-config

   apt-get install graphviz graphviz-dev
   easy_install networkx
   easy_install pygraphviz


In the future the Hop installer should handle some of these
dependencies automatically.



Installation
============

Standard EasyInstall installation
---------------------------------

The Hop package can be installed with 'EasyInstall' which is part of
'setuptools' (http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools).

If you have setuptools already installed you should be able to simply
install with

   easy_install Hop-0.1-rc1.tar.gz

You can install 'setuptools' by following the instructions at
http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installation-instructions
or on Linux distributions such as Debian or Ubuntu by a
commandline similar to

   apt-get install python-setuptools

Note that easy_install tries to download additional packages via the
internet if it cannot find them installed already.


Installation in a custom location
---------------------------------

If you want to install Hop somewhere else but the system default
please have a look at
http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#custom-installation-locations
which describes custom installations.
