 INSTALL
=========

This document gives an overview over additional requirements that
should be installed before Hop and Hop's installation process. The
latter should be painless because it only consists of pure python
scripts at the moment.

Please do not hesitate to contact Oliver Beckstein
<orbeckst@gmail.com> if problems occur or if you have suggestions on
how to improve the package or these instructions.


Quick instructions
==================

If you are familiar with ``easy_install`` from ``setuptools`` then try

  easy_install Hop-0.1.tar,gz

or 

  cd Hop-0.1
  python setup.py install

Otherwise read the `Requirements`_ and `Installation`_ instructions below.


Requirements
============

If Hop is installed with ``easy_install`` then some dependencies are
handled automatically; if not you will have to install packages
manually. This is always true for ``MDAnalysis`` at the
moment. For technical reasons, ``matplotlib`` must also be installed
manually if plotting is desired.


System requirements
-------------------

Tested with python 2.4, 2.5 (2.3 might still work, too) on Linux and Mac OS X.


Required python modules
-----------------------

::
   MDAnalysis    >= 0.6 or UNSTABLE    http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com
   numpy         >=1.0.3               http://numpy.scipy.org/
   NetworkX      <0.99                 https://networkx.lanl.gov/
   pygraphviz    0.36                  https://networkx.lanl.gov/pygraphviz/

``MDAnalysis`` requires additional modules; see the instructions at
its home page. Get the latest snapshot::

  http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com/files/MDAnalysis-0.6.0-rc1.tar.gz

or get the development version via subversion::

  svn checkout http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com/svn/branches/development-UNSTABLE-orbeckst MDAnalysis_UNSTABLE 

Hop has not been updated yet to use the new NetworkX 1.0 API hence
only earlier versions (e.g. networkx 0.36) are going to work reliably.

``pygraphviz`` also requires ``graphviz``; see its own installation
instructions.


Optional modules
----------------

(reduced functionality if not present)::

   matplotlib       >=0.91.3           http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ 
   rpy (and R)                         http://rpy.sourceforge.net/
   biopython                           http://www.biopython.org

When these modules are missing the code will raise an ImportError when
attempting to use them; their absence is not always handled gracefuly
and it is suggested to install at least ``matplotlib`` (pylab). ``R``
and ``rpy`` are only used for an experimental heatmap analysis and can
be safely ignored.



Optional external helper programs
---------------------------------

Some functions and classes can make use of external programs; none of
them are necessary for the core functionality of Hop but are listed
here for completeness.

VMD
     VMD's VolMap plugin can be used to generate densities. See
     `Visualization`_ for details on VMD.




Hints on obtaining packages
---------------------------

Many packages can be found through the local package manager (eg apt,
fink, yum, rpm). networkx is available at the above URL or with the
``easy_install`` command from python setuptools.

In Debian/Ubuntu::

   apt-get install python-setuptools pkg-config

   apt-get install graphviz graphviz-dev python-matplotlib
   easy_install networkx
   easy_install pygraphviz



Installation
============

Standard EasyInstall installation
---------------------------------

The Hop package can be installed with 'EasyInstall' which is part of
``setuptools`` (http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools).

If you have setuptools already installed you should be able to simply
install with

   easy_install Hop-0.1-rc1.tar.gz

You can install ``setuptools`` by following the instructions at
http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installation-instructions
or on Linux distributions such as Debian or Ubuntu by a
commandline similar to

   apt-get install python-setuptools

Note that ``easy_install`` tries to download additional packages via
the internet if it cannot find them installed already.


Installation in a custom location
---------------------------------

If you want to install Hop somewhere else but the system default
please have a look at
http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#custom-installation-locations
which describes custom installations.

Quick and dirty in my ``$HOME/packages`` directory::

 export PYTHONPATH=~/packages/lib/python 
 easy_install -d ~/packages Hop-0.1.tar.gz



Additional software
===================

The following software is not necessary to use the package itself but
has been found extremely useful by the author for using Hop or
analyzing data.


Interactive use and ``ipython``
-------------------------------

When Hop was developed, interactive use from a python command shell
turned out to be a very convenient application paradigm. ``ipython``
is very much recommended because of its ease to obtain interactive
help via ``?`` and ``??`` and to inspect objects via
TAB-completion. This is especially helpful because most of the
documentation is provided as python doc strings, both at the module
and at the class level.

For instance, to get an overview over interactive usage, load the
hop.interactive module and query the top level doc string::

 import hop.interactive
 hop.interactive ?


Visualization
-------------

VMD
  In order to visualize densities and water networks one can use VMD_
  <http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>, which reads natively psf and
  pdb files together with densities in OpenDX format.


Network analysis and layout
---------------------------

graphviz
  `graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_ is a versatile graph plotter,
  available for Linux and Mac OS X and integrated in most package
  systems. It is also required for ``pygraphviz``. It reads *dot*
  files.

Cytoscape
  `Cytoscape_ <http://www.cytoscape.org/>`_ is a very powerful network
  visualization platform; it reads *xgmml* files exported from Hop.
