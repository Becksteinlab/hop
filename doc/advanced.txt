Analysis of individual water trajectories
=========================================

One needs to figure out how to translate the 'iatom' number back to a psf index. (TODO: should keep a translation table when I make the selection.)

As a quick fix use the hop.psf, which keeps the original numbers; then just count...::

   awk 'BEGIN {iatom=0};
	$5 == "OH2" {serial=$1; res=$2; resn=$3; segname=$4; type=$5; 
		     printf "%6d %6d %3s %5d\n",iatom,serial,res,resn; iatom++}' hops_water.psf > iatom2serial.dat
   awk -v iatom=2025 '$1 == iatom {serial=$2; printf "serials %d to %d\n",serial,serial+2;}' iatom2serial.dat

Comparing water networks
========================

:: figure:: images/Network_1IFC_2IFB.jpg
   Comparison of water densities in I-FABP in apo (blue mesh) and holo
   (green mesh). The water network is shown as balls and sticks. Sites
   that are identified as common to both apo and holo are coloured
   red, others are blue. Created with the Water network analysis tools
   and VMD, rendered in Raster3D.

One question is if hydration sites change when a ligand binds or when
a residue is mutated. In order to answer this question one needs to
run MD simulations for the two states and calculate their density and
site map (as explained above). Then one remaps the sites of one
density on to the other. This allows one to use powerful numpy
expressions to compare the density grids and ultimately find out which
site label in simulation 1 corresponds to site label in 2.


Comparing densities
-------------------

First we need to identify the sites common to simulation 1 and 2.

The steps in the protocol:

   1. load pickled density object for simulation 1, eg water_1.pickle
   2. load pickled density object for simulation 2, eg water_2.pickle
   3. remap 2 on 1
   4. compare the site maps 

The following used the remap_density() and the
find_common_sites_with() methods; see the source to understand how
they work --- it is surprsingly simple because numpy is so powerful.

Assuming you have a reference density ref and the density you want to
compare to comp then you can remap comp to comp_ref with::

   from hop.sitemap import Density,remap_density
   ref = Density(...)
   comp = Density(...)
   comp_ref = remap_density(comp,ref)
   comp_ref.save('comp_remapped_to_ref')
   comp_ref.find_common_sites_with(ref,fmt='r%d')
   ref.save()
   comp_ref.save()

This creates the new density which needs to be used for all
comparisons. The find_common_sites_with() method annotates the
site_properties attribute with all sites that are overlapping in the
two densities. The label for 'common sites' is constructed from the
integer label in the reference and the fmt string (by default, '%d',
i.e. just the integer).

Once this is done construct and visualize the CombinedGraph.


One probably should re-create the hopping trajectory with the remapped
density although in practice the differences have been small for the
systems tested.



Comparing Graphs
----------------

Once the common sites have been identified we can colour the graphs
according to the 'conservation' of the site between different systems.


Displaying separate graphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following assumes that a HopGraph was produced previously. We are
now using the site_properties from the densities to add details to the
graph::

   import hop.sitemap, hop.graph
   # densities (1OPA and 1OPB)
   D = dict(apo=hop.sitemap.Density(...),holo=hop.sitemap.Density(...))

   # hopping graphs
   # add site_properties when loading the graph (bit of a hack)
   H = dict(apo=hop.graph.HoppingGraph(filename='1OPA/analysis/hopgraph.pickle',
				      site_properties=D['apo'].site_properties),
	    holo=hop.graph.HoppingGraph(filename='1OPB/analysis/hopgraph.pickle',
					site_properties=D['holo'].site_properties))
   for x,h in H.items():
      h.filter(exclude=dict(outliers=True,Nmin=5,unconnected=True))
      h.save()
      h.export(use_mapped_labels=True)  # .dot file for graphviz
      h.export3D()                      # filename.psf and filename.pdb (display with protein)
      print "Default file name: ", h.filename()


The CombinedGraph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to layout the two graphs together one can construct the union
of the two graphs, which we call the CombinedGraph. Constructing the
CombinedGraph requires densities that have been remapped and which
have their common sites identified::

   from hop.graph import CombinedGraph
   cg = CombinedGraph(g0=H['apo'],g1=H['holo'])

Now one can display the apo (g0) or the holo (g1) graph with the other
one only shown in the background::

   cg.filter(exclude={'bulk':True, 'outliers':True})  # make filtered graph
   cg.plot(0,filename='op0',max_node_size=900,linewidths=(0.1,))
   cg.plot(1,filename='op1',max_node_size=900,linewidths=(0.1,))

The colour of the nodes encodes the distance of the site centre from
the centre of geometry of the protein. The node diameter is
proportional to the occupancy. By default, only common sites are
labelled by their 'common label'. Edges that are common to both graphs
are shown in red.

Crystal water density
=====================

It is easy to compare densities. In order to compare to the hydration
sites seen in crystal structures it is convenient to build a density
from the positions of the waters in the crystal structure. The
crystallographic B-factor is converted into a root mean square
fluctuation 

  \sigma = \sqrt{3B/8\pi^2} 

and the density approximated by a gaussian at the site of the oxygen
x0, 

   g(x,x_0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma}^{3}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right).



Preparing a pdb
---------------

:Note: This section is incomplete and some of the scripts mentioned
are not provided. Please contact the author if you are interested.

Preparing a proper psf/pdb combo is actually more painful than it
looks. You will have to keep the B-factors along, select a subsystem
from the original pdb (one protein copy and waters), build missing
hydrogens, and trying to cope with Charmm's idiosyncracies.

1) download pdb file from PDB

2) split copies of the protein in the asymmetric unit cell and the water (using the primitive oneChain.py script)::
      #!/bin/bash

      ONECHAIN=${HOME}/Biop/Library/struct_manip/oneChain.py

      pdbid=1OPA
      CHAINS="A B"

      chain_d="./chains"
      mkdir -p ${chain_d}

      xwat_pdb="${chain_d}/${pdbid}_xwat.pdb"

      # water
      ${ONECHAIN}  -v -c ' ' -f ${pdbid}.pdb -o ${xwat_pdb}

      # protein chains
      for c in ${CHAINS}; do
	  pdb=${pdbid}_$c.pdb
	  wpdb="${chain_d}/${pdbid}_${c}W.pdb"
	  ${ONECHAIN}  -v -c $c -i ${pdbid}
	  cat $pdb ${xwat_pdb} > ${wpdb}
	  mv ${pdb} ${chain_d}
      done

3) RMS-fit all chains+all water files in VMD.
    * note the RMSD
    * count waters within CUTOFF=4.0 A::
         set w [atomselect <MOLID> 'water and name OH2']
         $w len
    * select one chain (typically, many waters and typical RMSD) 

4) process selected chain (without water) and water with pdb2charmm::
      from pdb2charmm import Structure
      p = Structure('1OPA_A.pdb','1OPA')
      p.fix(['ILE','cterm'])
      p.write('1OPA_A_0.crd')
      p.write('1OPA_A_0.pdb')

      w = Structure('1OPA_xwat.pdb','XWAT')
      w.fix('water')
      w.write('1OPA_w_0.crd')
      w.write('1OPA_w_0.pdb')

5) build final psf/pdb/crd in Charmm::
     charmm < 1opa_xtal.inp
   produces 1opa_a_xtal.{psf,crd,pdb}

The Charmm script only retains water within CUTOFF and builds all
missing heavy atoms and hydrogens. The protein sequence and the number
of crystal waters is coded in the script.

Build the crystal water density
-------------------------------

   from hop.sitemap import density_from_pdb
   d = density_from_pdb('1opa_a_xtal.psf','1opa_a_xtal.pdb')
   d.convert_density('water')
   d.map_sites(1.2)           # test...
   d.save('xtal_water')
   d.export()

 * original water resids are not kept
 * complicated
