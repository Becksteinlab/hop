  Basic USAGE
================

A quick overview of how one can use the Hop module. 


Input files
===========

For analysis, one needs

* a psf of the system
* a trajectory (dcd) that was RMS-fitted to a reference structure
  (this is very important because the density is histogramed on a
  fixed grid, i.e. in the laboratory frame; hence all overall
  translations and rotations need to be removed so that water density
  is not "washed out")

Example SGE python scripts are in doc/examples.



Example session
===============

The basic idea is to first map sites (find continuous regions of
density above a threshold) and then analyze a trajectory in terms of
transitions between those sites. 

In the following a example python session is shown. Each step can be
prototyped interactively in ``ipython``, using a short test
trajectory (eg 1000 frames), and then later combined into a script
(see the examples directory).

In the following it is assumed that a number of hop sub modules have
been loaded in the top level name space::

   #------------------------
   # beginning of example session
   #------------------------
   from hop.interactive import *

(The ``interactive`` module contains some high-level functions that
simplify certain tasks. See the source code for details; in
``ipython`` this can be achieved with the "??" operator.)


Defining hydration sites
------------------------

Sites are typical characterized by a density much higher than the bulk
density (eg 2-5 times higher, or if you think in terms of chemical
potentials then a change in density by a factor of 2.721 = e
corresponds to a change in (local) chemical potential of 1 kT, and
1.65 corresponds to 0.5 kT). However, this leaves out the bulk for
analysis so we could not map transitions to and from the bulk. To make
this kind of analysis useful one needs to add an additional site for
bulk: This allows calculation of exchange with the bulk:

   1. calculate a second density (density_bulk) for water which is at
      a distance greater than 3.5 Å (or 4 Å). One can use MDAnalysis
      as in the example below or VMD (with soluteselection='protein
      and not name H*', cutoff=3.5, backend='VMD' (but only if the
      trajectories are not big and fit into the computers main memory,
      i.e. typically < 1G).
   2. map the sites of this density at a low threshold (eg 0.6 of the
      bulk density).
   3. insert the largest site (number 1) into the list of high density sites
   4. recompute the map

The example session in ipython begins with the computation of the density::

   # water density
   density = make_density('./NPT/ifabp_water.psf','./NPT/ifabp_water_1_rmsfit.dcd',
			  'water',delta=1.0,atomselection='name OH2',backend='MDAnalysis')
   # bulk water density
   density_bulk = make_density('./NPT/ifabp_water.psf','./NPT/ifabp_water_1_rmsfit.dcd',
			       'bulk',delta=1.0,atomselection='name OH2',
			       soluteselection='protein and not name H*',
			       cutoff=3.5,backend='MDAnalysis')

   # threshold
   density.map_sites(2.71)
   density_bulk.map_sites(0.6)

   # add the biggest bulk site at position 1
   density.site_insert_bulk(density_bulk)   # hack!
   density.save()
   del density_bulk
 
In principle one is not restricted to defining sites via the density:
one could define regions in space from e.g. a Voronoi tesselation or
split space in a *binding site* and in an *unbound region*. None of
this is directly supported at the moment; however, all that needs to
be done is to provide a 3D array with grid cells numbered according
to the regions (see code in ``hop.sitemap``).

   outside the enveloping surface near the protein.

One can visualize the density by exporting it as a dx file and viewing
it in e.g. VMD::

   density.export_map(labels='sites',combined=True)  # combines all sites into a single file
   density.export_map(combined=False)                # writes each site separately to ./site_maps/

(labels='sites' excludes the bulk site from being included; see docs
for hop.sitemap.Density.site_labels for details.)

Sites can also written as pseudo atoms (pdb+psf combo)

   density.export3D('hydrationsites')

Once the sites are defined, the *hopping trajectory* is compiled from
the original one.



Hopping trajectory
------------------

The 3D movement of each water molecule (or typically, each water
oxygen) is translated into a 1D sequence of hops between sites::

   hops = make_hoppingtraj(density,'hop_water+bulk')

This can take a while so the result is stored as a new trajectory in
dcd format, with an accompanying pseudo psf file.

A hopping trajectory object can be recreated from the dcd and psf file
with ``hops = hop.trajectory.HoppingTrajectory(filename='hop_water+bulk')``.



Hopping graph
=============

The hopping trajectory is used together with the density to build a
transport graph object ``tgraph``; the transport graph object itself
is not really important but its ``hopgraph`` attribute is the final
desired *hopping graph*::

   # this can take a while (hours) for big systems...
   # (ignore 'Warning: Number of calls to function has reached maxfev = 800.')
   tgraph = build_hoppinggraph(hops,density)
   h = tgraph.hopgraph       # main result is the 'hopgraph'
   h.tabulate_k()            # show all calculated rate constants
   h.filter(exclude={'outliers':True, 'Nmin':2})     # see h.filter docs
   h.plot_fits()             # plot rate constant fits
   h.filter(exclude={'outliers':True, 'bulk':True})  # see h.filter docs
   h.export('water')         # write XGMML to visualize (filtered) graph 
   h.save('hopgraph')        # save hopgraph for further analysis

   #------------------------
   # end of example session
   #------------------------

``hopgraph.export(file)`` writes a XGMML file that can be viewed in
CytoScape; alternatively if the ``format='dot'`` keyword is supplied,
a dot file is written that can be rendered with, for instance,
GraphViz (Mac OS X). Alternatively, supply a format such as
format='png' to export() to let pygraphviz do the rendering.

One can re-analyze the hop graph later by loading the saved file::

   import hop.graph
   h = hop.graph.HoppingGraph(filename='hopgraph.pickle')
   h.filter(exclude={'outliers':True, 'Nmin':5, 'unconnected':True})
   h.plot_fits(directory='survival_times/nmin5',dt=5)
