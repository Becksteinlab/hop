The scripts here are examples of how to do typical tasks with hop;
they also show how submit jobs to the Sun Gridengine queuing system
using the staging.SunGridEngine framework: files are copied to local
scratch directories to improve performance.


Using the SGE scripts
---------------------

1) Prepare trajectories: RMS fit to a common reference frame (eg first
   frame of the apo simulation or representative  crystal structure of
   a related protein)

   1    rmsfit.py 

   (Note that it is MUCH faster (20x) to only fit the first frame of,
   say, the crystal structure to the reference and then use Charmm or
   Gromacs's trjconv to fit the trajectory to the rms-fitted crystal
   structure. Those tools are also capable of properly recentering the
   solvent about the protein and making whole molecules.)

   Care is needed at this step because everything else relies on
   properly aligned trajectories.

2) HOP analysis

   1    fulldensity.py
   2*   equivalencesites.py  ---> gives a remapped density for holo:
                                  use this density for further work!
   3    hoptraj.py
   4    graph.py
   5*   combinedgraph.py

Each script has to be run for each simulation separately except the
starred numbers for which results from two runs are combined. The apo
state is throughout taken as the reference simulation and density.

Or calculate the densities and then do steps 2 to 4 together

  2    hopanalysis.py


3) Statistics

       analysis.py

4) Site-resolved properties

       siteanalysis.py
