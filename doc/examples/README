=========================
 Hop example SGE scripts
=========================

The scripts here are examples of how to do typical tasks with hop;
they also show how submit jobs to the Sun Gridengine queuing system
using the staging.SunGridEngine framework: files are copied to local
scratch directories to improve performance.

In general beginners are better off doing a first run through the hop
protoicol interactively as described in :doc:`doc/basic.txt` and the
help text for the :mod:`hop.interactive` module. In python (indicated
by the ">>>" prompt which is not typed)::
  >>> import hop.interactive
  >>> help(hop.interactive)


.. Note:: The "example" scripts will *not* just run. They are examples of what
   the author used successfully in the past. Probably the most
   productive use is to look through the lower third of each script to
   see how certain tasks can be accomplished with hop.

If you want to use the scripts as they are you will also install the
``staging`` module somewhere where python can find it. The ``staging``
module can be found in the hop distribution in the ``extras``
directory. Copy the ``staging`` directory to a location that is on
your :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`.



Using the SGE scripts
---------------------

1) Prepare trajectories: RMS fit to a common reference frame (eg first
   frame of the apo simulation or representative  crystal structure of
   a related protein)

   1    rmsfit.py 

   (Note that it is MUCH faster (20x) to only fit the first frame of,
   say, the crystal structure to the reference and then use Charmm or
   Gromacs's trjconv to fit the trajectory to the rms-fitted crystal
   structure. Those tools are also capable of properly recentering the
   solvent about the protein and making whole molecules.)

   Care is needed at this step because everything else relies on
   properly aligned trajectories.

2) HOP analysis

   1    fulldensity.py
   2*   equivalencesites.py  ---> gives a remapped density for holo:
                                  use this density for further work!
   3    hoptraj.py
   4    graph.py
   5*   combinedgraph.py

Each script has to be run for each simulation separately except the
starred numbers for which results from two runs are combined. The apo
state is throughout taken as the reference simulation and density.

Or calculate the densities and then do steps 2 to 4 together

  2    hopanalysis.py


3) Statistics

       analysis.py

4) Site-resolved properties

       siteanalysis.py
