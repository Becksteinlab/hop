Now that you've got a hopping trajectory, you might want a hopping graph.

To obtain one, you'll need to first store your hopping trajectory in a variable python can operate on:

hoptraj = hop.trajectory.HoppingTrajectory(hoppsf=topology, hopdcd=trajectory)

Next you'll want to create a hop graph and store it in a variable:

tgraph = hop.interactive.build_hoppinggraph(hoptraj,density)

The above code creates a transport network. The hopgraph is only a component of this.

Store the hopgraph in a new variable; the hopgraph is an attribute of the tgraph:

h = tgraph.hopraph

Now we want to save it to the directory you're in:

h.save(filename).
