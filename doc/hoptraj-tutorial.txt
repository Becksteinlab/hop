To take your newly minted density and extract from him a trajectory, do as follows:

1. The functionality of the module MDAnalysis is used to generate this trajectory. 

Everything it does is referred to a universe, so you need to tell it what that universe is, 
using the following command:

u = MDAnalysis.Universe(topology, traj)

Next you'll need to specify the names of your water molecules, which vary from forcefield to forcefield. 

The following command identifies a group of atoms, which can then be manipulated by MDAnalysis, in this case water:

group = u.select_atoms("name water")

You will need to use whatever name your forcefield uses for water, such as "name OW" or some such.

Now that this is done, you can call the function which creates the trajectory. 

You'll have to store the trajectory in a variable so you can manipulate it in ipython:

hops = hop.trajectory.HoppingTrajectory(u.trajectory,group,density,**hopargs)

This requires the density you generated previously. 

**hopargs is a catch all allowing you to pass additional parameters, and can be neglected by all but advanced users.

All you have is a trajectory stored in a variable. You will need to write it to a file for permanent storage:

hops.write(filename)

Enter the filename with single or double quotes as desired, and you're finished.
