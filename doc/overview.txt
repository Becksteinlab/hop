 Documentation for Hop
=======================

Most of the documentation exists in the python doc strings. Use the
python ``help()`` function or ipython's ``?`` operator and use
introspection in ipython ("classname.<TAB>") to learn more about the
commands.


examples directory
------------------

The examples/ directory contains a bunch of scripts that were used in
production. The make use of the ``staging`` package for submitting jobs to
a cluster (via Sun Gridengine (SGE)). ``staging`` can be found in
extras/staging. Just drop it your PYTHONPATH if you want to use
it. Note that the staging scripts can be run from the commandline,
too, and do not actually require SGE. In this case they simply operate
on local files and do not copy data to and from a staging directory.
