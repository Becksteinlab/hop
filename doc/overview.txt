=======================
 Documentation for Hop
=======================

Most of the documentation exists in the python doc strings. Use the
python ``help()`` function or ipython's ``?`` operator and use
introspection in ipython ("classname.<TAB>") to learn more about the
commands.

The doc string for the :mod:`hop.interactive` module also has a
tutorial-style introduction. You would probably read it from within
the python interpreter with
  >>> import hop.interactive
  >>> help(hop.interactive)


Documentation files
-------------------

basic.txt:   
   Example session that shows how to process a single trajectory,
   starting with calculating hydration sites and ending with a hopping
   graph.

advanced.txt:
   Incomplete notes on more advanced usage such as comparing graphs.

waternetwork_poster.pdf:
   Low resolution copy of the poster presented at Biophysics
   2009. Gives an overview over some of the capabilities.


Not everything is documented externally yet. Please let me know what
you would like to do and I can tell you if it is already in there (but
undocumented), easy to do, or rather difficult.
