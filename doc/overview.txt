 Documentation for Hop
=======================

Most of the documentation exists in the python doc strings. Use the
python ``help()`` function or ipython's ``?`` operator and use
introspection in ipython ("classname.<TAB>") to learn more about the
commands.

The doc string for the :mod:`hop.interactive` module also has a
tutorial-style introduction. You would probably read it from within
the python interpreter with
  >>> import hop.interactive
  >>> help(hop.interactive)


Documentation files
-------------------

basic.txt:   
   Example session that shows how to process a single trajectory,
   starting with calculating hydration sites and ending with a hopping
   graph.

advanced.txt:
   Incomplete notes on more advanced usage such as comparing graphs.

waternetwork_poster.pdf:
   Low resolution copy of the poster presented at Biophysics
   2009. Gives an overview over some of the capabilities.


Not everything is documented externally yet. Please let me know what
you would like to do and I can tell you if it is already in there (but
undocumented), easy to do, or rather difficult.


examples directory
------------------

The examples/ directory contains a bunch of scripts that were used in
production. The make use of the ``staging`` package for submitting jobs to
a cluster (via Sun Gridengine (SGE)). ``staging`` can be found in
extras/staging. Just drop it your PYTHONPATH if you want to use
it. Note that the staging scripts can be run from the commandline,
too, and do not actually require SGE. In this case they simply operate
on local files and do not copy data to and from a staging directory.
