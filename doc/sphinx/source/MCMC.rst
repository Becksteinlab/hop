 Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling on a hop graph
==================================================

The hop graph encodes the dynamic information of the system. Using a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo method one can propagate the dynamics to much
longer time scales than accessible by the underlying MD simulations
alone and calculate fluxes across the network.
