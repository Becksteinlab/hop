Installation is simple: just unpack the tar ball into a directory that
is in the PYTHONPATH.


Tested with python 2.3, 2.4, 2.5

Required python modules:

numpy         >=1.0.3               http://numpy.scipy.org/
MDAnalysis*   >= 0.6 or UNSTABLE    http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com
NetworkX**    <0.99                 https://networkx.lanl.gov/
pygraphviz    0.36                  https://networkx.lanl.gov/pygraphviz/

*)  MDAnalysis requires additional modules; see the instructions at
    its home page
**) The code has not been updated yet to use the new NetworkX 1.0 API
    hence only earlier versions (e.g. 0.36) are going to work reliably.


Optional modules (but reduced functionality):

pylab            >=0.91.3           http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ 
gridDataFormats                     orbeckst@gmail.com
vmd                                 orbeckst@gmail.com
rpy (and R)                         http://rpy.sourceforge.net/

(When these are missing the code will raise an ImportError when
attempting to use these modules; their absence is not handled
gracefuly and it is very much suggested to install them.)

Many packages are found through the local package manager (eg apt,
fink, yum, rpm). networkx is available at the above URL or with the
`easy_install' command from python setuptools.

In Debian/Ubuntu/fink:

   apt-get install python-setuptools pkg-config

   apt-get install graphviz graphviz-dev
   easy_install networkx
   easy_install pygraphviz
