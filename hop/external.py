Generate densities with the help of external applications
=========================================================

Currently, only VMD_ is implemented via :func:`vmd.control`. We launch VMD in
text mode and start a simple server, then send commands to the server
to run the volmap plugin, and finally pick up the dx file.

.. warning:: Module might be broken.

        volmap(psf,dcd,dx,delta=1.0,atomselection=<VMD atomselect>,**kwargs)

        Arguments:

        psf       psf topology file
        dcd       trajectory that is RMS-fitted on the protein
        dx        output file for the density (OpenDX format), in A^-3.
        delta     size of a grid cell in Angstrom
        load_new  True: load dx and psf in VMD, False: just send volmap command
        atomselection
                  VMD selection string (with python keyword-interpolation of
                  all additional sel_args)

        This function just loads the data into VMD and runs the VolMap
        plugin with appropriate values
        (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/current/ug/node141.html and
        http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/volmapgui/).

        The default atom selection being used calculates the water density in A^-3:
           atomselect top {name OH2}

        The VolMap checkpoint:*.dx file is automatically removed.

        Examples:

        * Bulk water density (exclude water near protein)

            atomselection='name OH2 and not within %(exclusion)f of protein',
            exclusion=3.5
