Quickstart: using the hop package --- :mod:`hop.interactive`
============================================================

A typical session starts with a trajectory (which should have been
RMS-fitted to a reference structure). Any topology and trajectory file
suitable for MDAnalysis_ can be used such as PSF+DCD, PDB+XTC or a
single PDB. In the following Charmm/NAMD psf and dcd files are used as
examples.

We will use the high-level wrapper functions in :mod:`hop.interactive`:

>>> from hop.interactive import *

.. _MDAnalysis:: http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com

Hydration sites
---------------

Hydration sites are sites of water density higher than the bulk
density but one special site is the bulk. The hydration sites and the
bulk site are computed in two separate steps.


High density sites
..................

First build the density of the water oxygens.

>>> density = make_density(psf,dcd,filename,delta=1.0)

If you have VMD with the VolMap plugin installed *and* your trajectory
fits into your computer's RAM you can also choose the VMD backend to
compute the density (which can be marginally faster):

>>> density = make_density(psf,dcd,filename,delta=1.0,backend='VMD')


The density is also saved as a pickled python object so that one can
easily reload it. The density is also exported as a dx file for
visualization (e.g. use :func:`hop.interactive.visualize_density`,
which calls :program:`VMD`).

From the density one creates the 'site map' for a given threshold (by
default this is a multiple of the water bulk density):

>>> density.map_sites(threshold=2.72)

Experiment with the threshold; :class:`hop.analysis.DensityAnalysis` can help
to systematically explore the parameter space, and it is also helpful
to load the density into a visualization software such as VMD and
interactively explore contour levels. Values between 1.65 and 3 have
given decent results in the past but this is system-dependent.)


Bulk site
.........

For a full analysis of hopping events one also needs to define a bulk
site. This is currently accomplished by calculating a second 'bulk'
density (all water not within 3.5 A of the protein) and manually
inserting the bulk site into the site map for the first density.

>>> density_bulk = make_density(psf,dcd,'bulk',delta=1.0,
...         atomselection='name OH2',
...         soluteselection='protein and not name H*',
...         cutoff=3.5
...         )

Using VMD's VolMap can be potentially be faster --- try it if the
default seems too slow to you:

>>> density_bulk = make_density(psf,dcd,'bulk',delta=1.0,
...         atomselection='name OH2 and not within 3.5 of (protein and name not hydrogen)',
...         backend='VMD',load_new=False)

The bulk density should be a big, well defined volume so we choose a
fairly low threshold:

>>> density_bulk.map_sites(0.6)

Add the biggest bulk site:

>>> density.site_insert_bulk(density_bulk)
>>> density.save()
>>> del density_bulk

.. Note:: Behind the scenes, the bulk is simply prepended to the list
   of all sites (``density.sites``,
   :attr:`hop.sitemap.Density.sites`), found so far. By convention the
   site at position 1 in the list of all sites is treated specially in
   many parts of hop (it has the so-called sitelabel "1", which is
   simply the position in the list of sites) and hence you might
   encounter unexpected behaviour later if you do not insert a bulk
   site.

Statistics about the sites can be produced with

>>> analyze_density(density,figname)

The results figures will be named `<figname>.pdf`.


Remapping for comparing site maps
.................................

This section is only relevant if you plan on comparing site maps. Then
you *must* compare the density to your reference density *now* before
proceeding. You will

   1) remap this density to be defined on the same grid as the reference
      density (for this to work, this density must have been generated from
      a trajectory that has been RMS-fitted to the same reference structure
      as; see hop.trajectory.rms_fit_trj() and
      hop.trajectory.fasta2select())

      >>> ref_density = hop.sitemap.Density(filename='my_reference_density')
      >>> remapped_density = hop.sitemap.remap_density(density,ref_density)

   2) find the equivalence sites in the two densities and add those sites
      to **both** densities:

      >>> remapped_density.find_equivalence_sites_with(ref_density,verbosity=3)
      >>> remapped_density.save(<filename>)
      >>> ref_density.save()

      (You must also recalculate the reference densities hopping
      trajectory (see below) because some sites may have been merged into
      'equivalence sites'. See docs for
      hop.sitemap.find_equivalence_sites_with() and
      hop.graph.CombinedGraph()).

      From now on, work with the remapped density:
      >>> density = remapped_density


Hopping trajectory
------------------

Next we translate the dcd into a 'hopping trajectory' (saved in dcd
format) in which coordinates for a given water oxygen are replaced by
the site it visits at each time step.

>>> hops = make_hoppingtraj(density,'hop_water+bulk')

All further analysis should use this hopping trajectory (from disk) as
it is computationally much cheaper to read the trajectory than to
re-translate the coordinate trajectory (which is done behind the
scences if the hopping trajectory is not available).


Hopping graph
-------------

The final step is to map out the graph of transitions between sites
(using the hopping trajectory):

>>> tn = build_hoppinggraph(hops,density)

tn.hopgraph holds this graph (tn.graph just contains all jumps
including the interstitial and off-sites). The edges of hopgraph are
the rate constants k_ji (in 1/ps) for hops i --> j. They are computed
from an exponential fit to the site survival function S_ji(t) for
particles waiting to hop from i to j.

The density is provided to attach data to the nodes of the
hopgraph. It is required for visualization and analysis (although not
strictly necessary for the hopgraph itself).

Further analysis uses tn.hopgraph:

>>> h = tn.hopgraph           # main result is the 'hopgraph'
>>> h.save('hopgraph')        # save the hopping graph (necessary for cg part)
>>> h.filter(exclude={'outliers':True, 'Nmin':2, 'unconnected':True})
>>> h.show_rates()            # show all calculated rate constants (filtered graph)
>>> h.plot_fits(xrange(301))  # plot rate constant fits for t=0ps to 300ps
>>> h.plot_fits()
>>> h.export('water')         # write dot file to visualize (filtered) graph
>>> h.plot_site_occupancy('siteoccupancy')  # plot site occupancy from graph ---is NOT working
>>> h.plot_residency_times('residencytimes')# residency times --- is NOT working

To compare the water network based on density with another hop graph
(based on ref_density), construct the CombinedGraph:

>>> h_ref = hop.graph.HoppingGraph(filename=<filename>) --- basically repeat steps from
###                                                     --- ref_density only with differ labels
>>> cg = hop.graph.CombinedGraph(g0=h,g1=h_ref)
>>> cg.plot(0,'cg_h',linewidths=(0.01,))
>>> cg.plot(1,'cg_h_ref',linewidths=(0.01,))


.. rubric:: TODO

Currently un(der)-documented:
* Remapping densities to a reference density (see hop.sitemap.remap_density).
* Comparing densities and finding equivalence sites (see
  hop.sitemap.find_common_sites() and Density.find_equivalence_sites_with()).
* Comparing hopgraphs across different simulations: requires equivalence sites in
  both densities; then build the hop.graph.CombinedGraph().
