Right now the tests/ directory is not really functional and only
contains snippets of code I used during writing modules. Eventually,
however, I should have proper test cases and ideally a regression
suite.

The following is a list of desirable tests; pretty much all of them
require MDAnalysis so it's not listed in the (assumed) dependencies.


* density from DCD 
  sitemap, trajectory?, interactive?

* bulk density from DCD
  sitemap, trajectory?, interactive?

* density from pdb (with B-factor water density)
  sitemap

* Density, Grid 
  - from pickled file
    sitemap  
  - from dx file
    sitemap, [gridData]

* sitemap

* equivalence sites between two densities

* hopping trajectory from dcd and Density with sitemap

* hopping graph from hopping trajectory and sitemap

* comparison of two hop graphs

----

* plotting functions

* heatmaps
