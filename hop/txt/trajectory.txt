This outline is intended to map out what code is written in hop.trajectory, and as a waste-bin for my 
thoughts on the code to help me figure out what exactly is there. A more organized outline should be made in 
the future.

IMPORTS:
hop.constants, hop.utilities, msg, set_verbosity, SelectionError. These occur everywhere in Oliver's code.
They are clearly useful function dumps; the only unifying theme behind them is that they contain useful stuff
but that stuff is useful in all sorts of places.

numpy, MDAnalysis, MDAnalysis.coordinates, warnings. Two big packages full of trajectory analysis software and 
general analysis software; they are the work-horses of this business.

Lines 39 - 47 (try statement): What is a try statement? Naturally, it tries the try clause, and if there is
an exception, it passes to the except/finally clause. It stores the exception and tries again. If it happens
again, it passes to the finally clause and gives up.

totaltime (58 - 60): Calls a function from some other module; presumably book keeping

Line 63: Very important! I finally understand what the trajectory is; it says which molecules were at which point
in the network.
