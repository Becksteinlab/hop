# vmd remote control --- client/server scripts to run VMD from python
# Copyright (c) 2009 Oliver Beckstein <orbeckst@gmail.com>
# Released under the GNU Lesser Public License, version 3 or later.
#
# based on bounce.tcl and vmdcollab.tcl
# from http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/script_library/scripts/vmdcollab/
# with help from Justin Gullingsrud <justin@ks.uiuc.edu>
#
# Start this script in VMD and send commands to the listening port to have VMD 
# execute them remotely (eg 'telnet localhost 5555'). However, this is really 
# meant to be used with vmd_ctl.py. That is why we have a special 
# RESPONSE_TERMINATOR to ease the communication (see Protocol)
#
# Usage: vmd -e remote_ctl.tcl
#    or  vmd> source remote_ctl.tcl
#
# Security: we only allow connections from localhost (see acpt)
#  
# Protocol: port 5555
#           RESPONSE_TERMINATOR to signify end of VMDs response
#
# Commands: some transmitted commands have special meaning and are interpreted
#           by the server and not passed on to Tcl:
#
#           close             close the current connection (socket)
#           exit              exit the server (no more connections possible,
#                             but current connections are still open)
#           loglevel N        set LOGLEVEL to value N (0<=N<=2)
